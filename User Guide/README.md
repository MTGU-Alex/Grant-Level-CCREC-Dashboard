**Source Data:** 
This dashboard uses data stored in the NSC CCREC data repository, specifically the AY and service files. Reference [Accessing the NSC CCREC Repository.dox](https://github.com/MTGU-Alex/ccrec_dashboard_private/blob/master/User%20Guide/Accessing%20the%20NSC%20CCREC%20Repository.docx) found above for more details on accessing NSC CCREC data. If you do not currently have access to your data but would still like to run the dashboard, you can use the dummy data found here.
